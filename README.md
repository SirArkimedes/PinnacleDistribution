# PinnacleV4.10
nopCommerce Version 4.10 

I have edited many style sheets, and Views by removeing or customizing existing code
Some views, and applications can be edited from the admin page on pinnacledistro.com
Which I have edited while, other settings I am able to remove the code or add my own.
For most changes that I have made I have left an @JONAS page so that I can determine
where the changes I have made are. For other changes that I have not documented as 
well I would check for commits and look directly at the additionas and subtractions
for entries.
